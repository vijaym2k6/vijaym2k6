### About

I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science (AIML) with a focus on building **AI-powered systems that solve real problems**. My work centers on backend engineering, intelligent automation, and developer tooling—with an emphasis on reliability, safety, and clean architecture.

I focus on building systems designed to run reliably, not just exist as demos.

---

### Focus Areas

```
├── AI Systems          → Intent parsing, safety layers, explainability
├── Backend Engineering → APIs, pipelines, cloud-native architecture
├── Autonomous Systems  → Monitoring, threat detection, failsafe design
└── Developer Tooling   → Clean interfaces, structured documentation
```
